title: Building Extempore from source on OSX & Linux
categories: setup osx linux

**\*Update October 2015\*** building from source is now much easier
(assuming you’re happy to use the GitHub master branch). Updated
instructions can now be found in the
[INSTALL.md](https://github.com/digego/extempore/blob/master/INSTALL.md)
file in the Extempore source distribution.

# Ok, I’ve done that, so how do I start using Extempore?

The `extempore` executable on its own is cool, but things really start
to get interesting when you can interact with it by sending it xtlang
code to evaluate. So the next step is to [set up your text editor for
working with Extempore source
code](2012-09-26-interacting-with-the-extempore-compiler.org).

It’s probably worth [building the standard
library](2013-12-16-building-the-extempore-standard-library.org) as
well—it’ll save you heaps of time if you’re restarting Extempore often.

After you’re set up, then the next step is to learn about xtlang and the
Extempore runtime. The [docs index](../extempore-docs/index.org) has a
complete list of all the posts covering this stuff, and is probably the
place to go next. Have fun :)
