# What is Extempore?

Extempore is a programming language and runtime environment designed to support 'cyberphysical programming'. Cyberphysical programming supports the notion of a human programmer operating as an active agent in a real-time distributed network of environmentally aware systems. The programmer interacts with the distributed real-time system procedurally by modifying code on-the-fly.

Extempore provides a completely hotswappable runtime environment with a strong temporal semantics, a flexible concurrency architecture, builtin support for distributed heterogenous operation (both OS and Architecture), and aims to provide flexible compiler-as-a-service functionality. Extempore makes extensive use of the LLVM project to provide back-end code generation.
